## About

In this repository, you will find my solutions to the programming exercises presented in Chapter X of the book. These solutions are meant to serve as a reference and learning resource for anyone studying Java programming using this textbook.

Feel free to use these solutions as a guide or reference when working on your own exercises, but I encourage you to try solving the problems independently first to maximize your learning. Because it is reall working if you are trying to solve each problem without looking any answer online.

## Getting Started

To access the solutions, simply navigate to the respective chapter's folder in this repository. Each folder is organized by chapter number, and within each chapter folder, you will find individual Java files named after the exercise number they correspond to.


To run a solution, you will need a Java development environment such as [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) or [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/). You can also compile and run the Java files using the command line.

```shell
javac ExerciseX.java  # Compile the Java file
java ExerciseX        # Run the compiled program
