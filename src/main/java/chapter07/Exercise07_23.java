* As the students enter, the first student, denoted as S1, opens every locker.
* Then the second student, S2, begins with the second locker, denoted as L2, and closes every other locker.
* Student S3 begins with the third locker and changes every third locker (closes it if it was open and opens it if it was closed).
* Student S4 begins with locker L4 and changes every fourth locker.
* Student S5 starts with L5 and changes every fifth locker, and so on, until student S100 changes L100
